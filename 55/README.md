# GAN and DCGAN

Implementation of GAN and DCGAN from PyTorch

No saving checkpoints saving/loading implemented. Please adjust to your needs accordingly.

The current runnable code is in `trainGAN.py`, and the models are stored in `model.py`. The newly added `DCGAN.ipynb` has the code for generating animals from animal faces dataset.
